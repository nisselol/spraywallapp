# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Main development areas
1. app/ directory - This is where your screens/pages go
2. components/ directory - This is where your reusable components go
3. assets/ directory - Images, fonts, and other static assets
4. constants/ directory - App constants and configuration
5. hooks/ directory - Custom React hooks
   
## app/ file structure
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx          # Root layout (wraps entire app)
â”œâ”€â”€ +not-found.tsx       # 404 page
â””â”€â”€ (tabs)/              # Tab navigation group
    â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx      # Tab layout
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx        # Home tab (/)
    â””â”€â”€ explore.tsx      # Explore tab (/explore)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
